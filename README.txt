Names: Ketan (klchatterjee@wpi.edu) + Brandon 

Platform: Windows with Visual Studio 2022

Files: Our game is in SpaceJam/game0/vs-2022 - THIS IS ALSO WHERE THE .SLN AND OTHER PROJECT FILES ARE!!! THERE ARE 2 .SLN FILES, THE ONE IN VS-2022 IS THE REAL ONE. 
The reason there are two is more or less because it took a while to get file sharing working through github and I really did not want to mess anything up. Sorry for any confusion. 
They are both called saucer-shoot.sln because I used the provided example from the first project, since we are using Professor Claypool's engine for this game, 
and after trying to change it and messing up the whole VS solution I gave up and left it as is. BUT EVERYTHING DOES WORK I PROMISE.

Code Structure: All game files are in vs-2022. All engine files are in SpaceJam/dragonfly

Compilation: Uses the built in compiler from Visual Studio. 

Instructions: WASD to move. Avoid being detected by lasers and guards (colored red). Grab the key to open the locked door (colored yellow). Get to the exit to advance (colored green).
